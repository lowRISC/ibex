Ibex has originally been developed by the PULP team at ETH Zürich and
University of Bologna under the name Zero-riscy. In December 2018, Ibex has
been contributed to lowRISC who is maintaining and advancing the design since
then.

Similarly, the Ibex `dv/formal` work was originally developed by the University of
Oxford in the summer of 2023. In the summer of 2024 this work was extended
for and contributed to lowRISC who is now maintaining and advancing the design.

Throughout the years, Ibex has seen contributions from many people and we at
lowRISC are very thankful for all of them. This file lists the many people who
contributed to what is called Ibex today. If you made a contribution to Ibex
in the form of source code, bug reports, testing, marketing, or any other form,
please feel free to open a pull request to get your name added to this file.
